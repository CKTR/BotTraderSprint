// EVENTS
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file lets you subscribe functionality to happen at different
// Event points throughout the application.
//
// These Events are separate from CodeIgniter's built-in Hooks, and are
// slightly more flexible, using features in PHP 5.4+.
//
// This is a (possibly incomplete) list of events included throughout
// the system.
